really rough, not tested on anything apart from my computer. requires a folder called resources (doesn't have to be, but it is the default name in the .config file) that contains subfolders 'audio', 'video', 'generated_audio', 'generated_video'. You need to have your background video in 'resources/video', and your stock audio in 'resources/audio'. Haven't really tested with videos not in 1080x1920 format, though it should be pretty easy to edit the code to check for and if needed, trim the video to that size. I coded this in a fit of motivation, got bored and decided to finish it in as little effort as possible so it wouldn't be a complete waste. As of such, it has some really bare and rough edges, with some functions missing. If you're looking for a basic, does the job and editable program, this is the one.
